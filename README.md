# Cryptography-puzzle-hunt-system
A Discrete Mathematics learning system that combines cryptographic puzzles, modular arithmetic, and scoring mechanisms to enhance logical thinking and problem-solving skills.
The Cryptographic Puzzle Hunt System is an interactive educational project developed to demonstrate the practical applications of Discrete Mathematics concepts through a puzzle-based learning approach. This system transforms theoretical topics into engaging challenges that help users improve their logical reasoning and problem-solving skills.
The project focuses on key areas of Discrete Mathematics such as classical cryptography, modular arithmetic, prime numbers and number theory. Each puzzle requires the user to analyze information, apply mathematical techniques and decode hidden words or find numbers in order to advance through different levels of difficulty.
By combining learning with gameplay elements like scoring, progression and feedback, the system encourages active participation and deeper understanding of mathematical concepts. This project also highlights the importance of Discrete Mathematics in real-world applications including cybersecurity, data encryption and secure communication.It serves as both an educational tool and a demonstration of how mathematical theory can be transformed into meaningful and enjoyable problem-solving experiences.
